# Defining Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define Physical AI and distinguish it from traditional AI
- Explain the key characteristics of humanoid robotics
- Identify the main applications and challenges in the field
- Understand the interdisciplinary nature of Physical AI

## Key Concepts

- **Physical AI**: AI systems that interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators
- **Humanoid Robotics**: Robots designed with human-like form and capabilities
- **Embodied Cognition**: The idea that cognitive processes are influenced by the body's interactions with the environment
- **Morphological Computation**: The idea that the physical structure of a robot contributes to its intelligence

## Theory Summary

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional AI systems that operate primarily in digital environments to AI systems that must navigate, interact with, and adapt to the physical world. This requires a fundamentally different approach to intelligence, one that integrates perception, action, and learning in real-time physical environments.

Humanoid robotics specifically focuses on creating robots with human-like form and capabilities, which offers unique advantages in human environments and human-robot interaction scenarios.

## Hands-On Activity

## Tools & Components Required

- Simulation environment (e.g., Gazebo, PyBullet, or Webots)
- Python programming environment
- Basic knowledge of robotics frameworks (ROS/ROS2)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Set up the simulation environment
2. Load the humanoid robot model
3. Configure sensors (cameras, LIDAR, IMU)
4. Run basic perception algorithms
5. Analyze the robot's interaction with the environment

## Code Snippets

```python
# Example: Basic robot initialization in simulation
import pybullet as p
import pybullet_data

# Connect to physics server
physicsClient = p.connect(p.GUI)
p.setAdditionalSearchPath(pybullet_data.getDataPath())

# Load plane and robot
planeId = p.loadURDF("plane.urdf")
robotStartPos = [0,0,1]
robotStartOrientation = p.getQuaternionFromEuler([0,0,0])
robotId = p.loadURDF("humanoid.urdf", robotStartPos, robotStartOrientation)
```

## Review Questions

1. What distinguishes Physical AI from traditional AI systems?
2. Why is the humanoid form factor important in robotics?
