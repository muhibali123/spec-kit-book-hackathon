# Sensors and Actuators in Humanoid Robots

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Identify different types of sensors used in humanoid robots
- Understand the role of actuators in robot movement and control
- Analyze sensor fusion techniques for enhanced perception
- Design basic control systems for actuator coordination

## Key Concepts

- **Proprioceptive Sensors**: Internal sensors measuring robot state (joint angles, forces, IMU)
- **Exteroceptive Sensors**: External sensors perceiving the environment (cameras, LIDAR, touch)
- **Actuators**: Motors and devices that produce robot movement (servos, hydraulic, pneumatic)
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combining data from multiple sensors for better perception
- **Force Control**: Precise control of interaction forces with the environment

## Theory Summary

Humanoid robots require sophisticated sensory and motor systems to interact effectively with human environments. The sensory system provides information about both the robot's internal state and the external environment, while the actuator system enables movement and interaction. The integration of these systems is crucial for achieving human-like capabilities and safe human-robot interaction.

Sensors in humanoid robots include vision systems for object recognition, tactile sensors for manipulation, inertial measurement units for balance, and proprioceptive sensors for joint position and force feedback. Actuators must provide precise control, adequate power, and safe operation, often requiring advanced control algorithms to coordinate multiple degrees of freedom.

## Code Snippets

```python
import numpy as np

class SensorFusion:
    def __init__(self):
        self.camera_data = None
        self.lidar_data = None
        self.imu_data = None
        self.joint_data = None

    def kalman_filter(self, measurement, prediction, uncertainty):
        """Simplified Kalman filter for sensor fusion"""
        # Prediction update
        predicted_state = prediction
        predicted_uncertainty = uncertainty + 0.1  # Process noise

        # Measurement update
        kalman_gain = predicted_uncertainty / (predicted_uncertainty + 0.1)  # Measurement noise
        updated_state = predicted_state + kalman_gain * (measurement - predicted_state)
        updated_uncertainty = (1 - kalman_gain) * predicted_uncertainty

        return updated_state, updated_uncertainty

    def fuse_vision_lidar(self, camera_pos, lidar_pos, confidence=0.7):
        """Fuse camera and LIDAR position estimates"""
        fused_pos = confidence * camera_pos + (1 - confidence) * lidar_pos
        return fused_pos

class ActuatorController:
    def __init__(self, num_joints):
        self.num_joints = num_joints
        self.target_positions = np.zeros(num_joints)
        self.current_positions = np.zeros(num_joints)
        self.max_torque = 100.0  # Nm

    def position_control(self, joint_index, target_pos, current_pos, kp=10.0):
        """Simple proportional position control"""
        error = target_pos - current_pos
        torque = kp * error
        # Limit torque to safe values
        torque = np.clip(torque, -self.max_torque, self.max_torque)
        return torque

    def force_control(self, joint_index, target_force, actual_force, kp=1.0, ki=0.1):
        """Force control with integral component"""
        error = target_force - actual_force
        self.integral_error = getattr(self, 'integral_error', 0) + error
        torque = kp * error + ki * self.integral_error
        return torque
