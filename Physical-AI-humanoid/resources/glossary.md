# Glossary of Terms

This glossary contains definitions for key terms used throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course.

## A

**Actuator**: A component of a robot that converts energy into motion. Common types include servo motors, stepper motors, and hydraulic/pneumatic actuators.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

## B

**Behavior-Based Robotics**: An approach to robotics that emphasizes the use of simple, reactive behaviors to create complex robot behavior.

## C

**Cognitive Architecture**: An explicit specification of the cognitive components and processes required to perform tasks in a domain.

## D

**Deep Learning**: A subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.

## E

**Embodied Cognition**: The theory that cognitive processes are influenced by the body's interactions with the environment.

## H

**Humanoid Robot**: A robot with human-like form and capabilities, designed to interact with human environments and humans themselves.

## M

**Morphological Computation**: The idea that the physical structure of a robot contributes to its intelligence and reduces computational load.

## P

**Physical AI**: AI systems that interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators, as opposed to traditional AI systems that operate primarily in digital environments.

## S

**Sensor Fusion**: The process of combining sensory data from multiple sources to improve accuracy and reliability.

## T

**Trajectory Planning**: The process of determining a path for a robot to follow from a start to a goal position.
