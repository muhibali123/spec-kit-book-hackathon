# Create Development Plan for Physical AI Course

## PROMPT_TEXT
Create a complete Development Plan for building the book/course:
"Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course" in Docusaurus.

The Development Plan Must Include:
1. Docusaurus Setup & Configuration

Step-by-step instructions for initializing a Docusaurus project

Installation requirements (Node.js, npm/yarn, MDX, etc.)

Site configuration (docusaurus.config.js)

Theme selection and customization

Plugins and dependencies (e.g., search, versioning, diagram support)

Sidebar configuration and navigation rules

Versioning strategy for course updates

2. Content Development Phase

Detailed roadmap for writing chapters and lessons

Workflow for drafting, reviewing, and finalizing content

Guidelines for hands-on labs, code snippets, images, and diagrams

Review and quality check checkpoints

Integration of exercises, quizzes, and micro-projects

Collaboration workflow (if multiple authors or contributors)

3. File Structure for Chapters & Lessons

Suggested folder structure for chapters, lessons, and assets

Naming conventions for Markdown / MDX files

Recommended placement for images, code samples, and media

Sidebar mapping for each chapter and lesson

Best practices for maintaining consistency and scalability

Output Style Guidelines

Present the plan in a clear, actionable, step-by-step format

Use bullet points, tables, or numbered lists for clarity

Tone: professional but beginner-friendly, aligned with the Constitution's Brand Voice

Must be ready-to-implement, not just high-level guidance

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Created a comprehensive development plan for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course in Docusaurus, including:

1. Implementation Plan (plan.md): Detailed phases for setup, content development, and deployment
2. Research Findings (research.md): Addressed key clarifications about themes, interactive elements, and asset management
3. Data Model (data-model.md): Defined the structure for course content, chapters, lessons, and related entities
4. Quickstart Guide (quickstart.md): Step-by-step instructions for setting up the development environment and creating content

The plan addresses all requirements including Docusaurus setup, content development workflow, file structure, and navigation configuration. It provides actionable, implementation-ready guidance aligned with the project constitution.

## OUTCOME
Successfully created a complete development plan with all required components for building the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course in Docusaurus.

## EVALUATION
The development plan is comprehensive, actionable, and ready for implementation. All required elements have been addressed with appropriate detail for immediate use in the development process.
