### 4. Accessibility Over Exclusivity
Technical depth is maintained while ensuring content remains approachable for beginners. Complex concepts are broken down into digestible components with clear explanations and visual aids.

### 5. Safety and Ethics Integration
Robotics safety and ethical considerations are woven throughout the curriculum, not treated as an afterthought. Learners understand the responsibility that comes with building autonomous systems.

### 6. Open and Collaborative Learning
The course encourages community participation, peer learning, and open-source contribution, fostering a collaborative environment where knowledge is shared and collectively improved.

### 7. Practical Tools and Technologies
Focus on industry-standard tools, frameworks, and platforms that learners will encounter in professional settings, ensuring practical applicability of skills acquired.

## Constraints

### Technical Stack Limitations
- **Docusaurus Dependency**: All content must be structured and presented using the Docusaurus documentation framework, limiting formatting and interactive capabilities to what Docusaurus supports.
- **Technology Integration**: Content must be compatible with Docusaurus's static site generation, potentially limiting real-time interactive elements or complex simulations.

### Instructional Scope Boundaries
- **Target Audience**: Content must remain accessible to beginner-to-intermediate learners, preventing deep dives into highly specialized or advanced mathematical concepts without proper foundational preparation.
- **Resource Requirements**: Practical exercises must be achievable with commonly available hardware or accessible simulation environments, avoiding requirements for expensive or specialized equipment.

### Knowledge Level Considerations
- **Prerequisites**: Content must assume only basic programming knowledge and fundamental mathematics, requiring careful balance between accessibility and technical depth.
- **Complexity Management**: Advanced concepts must be introduced gradually, with clear connections to foundational knowledge, preventing cognitive overload.

### Platform Limitations
- **Static Content Constraints**: Docusaurus's static nature limits dynamic content, real-time code execution, and interactive simulations that might enhance learning.
